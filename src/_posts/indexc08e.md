[Progetto GRANT Cairo 2009](index2b8b.html?p=600) {#progetto-grant-cairo-2009 .entry-title}
=================================================

Contracting Authority: Delegation of the European Commission in Egypt\
Local Cultural Activities -- GRANT Application Form**\
**Budget line: BGUE-19080101-C1-AIDCO\
Reference: EuropeAid/1 28030/L/ACT/EG

**Progetto GRANT Cultural Heritage Cairo 2009**\
This action implies the preparation of a draft for a *Euro- Mediterranean Project on Cultural Heritage* starting from the "*preliminary draft*" contained in the Full Application Form (point 1.7) which will be put on line on the web site [www.cairocongress.com](http://www.cairocongress.com/) so that scientists from all over the world  and particularly from countries facing the Mediterranean Sea may contribute with their suggestions. The final draft will be submitted for approval when the Congress will be held in Cairo. next December 6 -- 8.\
The *"preliminary draft"* takes into account the Italian *"Cultural Heritage"* Project which was carried out from 1997 up to 2005. This Project was the most effective action in Europe in this field as far as science and technology are concerned: a 30 million euro project with more than 3,000 scientists. That action was financed by the Italian Ministry of Research and by the Italian National Research Council (CNR) and was prepared and developed by a team of scientists under the leadership of prof. Angelo Guarino. The same team is nowadays gathered inside the *"Investing in Culture"* Association, president prof. A. Guarino.\
Analogously, the previous three international Congresses held in Italy (Catania), France (Paris) and Spain (Alcala' de Henares) were prepared and executed by the same team involved in the present action. Endly, one of the most prestigious international Journal containing scientific papers on Cultural Heritage, *"The Journal of Cultural Heritage"* published in English in Paris by Elsevier has had as founder and editor in chief up to 2008 the president of "Investing in Culture" and as organizing secretariat in Rome the same team involved in the present action.
