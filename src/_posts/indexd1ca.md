Nevertheless tourism statistics show that there is a continuous increase all over Europe of aged persons visiting museums. Difficulties to move inside huge galleries, to understand directional internal signs, to find essential services like restrooms, cafeterias, etc, may deprive an aged person of the pleasure of the visit. The use of wheel chairs for disabled persons, either hand or motor driven, is always possible but they represent a rather rude and sometimes offensive solution for many visitors who will refuse to use these facilities.\</span\>\<br /\> \<span style=\"color: \#993300;\"\>Objective of this proposal is to create a an independent wheeled robot prototype called "Butler Jerome" which has to be specific for a single museum. Its main feature is its perfect knowledge of the spaces and services of that museum, both single objects like paintings and s culptures but also the position of services like caffetterias, restrooms, shopping areas. It has to be able to move inside the museum interacting with an aged person sitting on it with natural language so that the visitor may ask questions relative to single objects and services inside that specific museum. The project has to be divided into the following steps:\</span\>\<br /\> \<span style=\"color: \#993300;\"\>1 -- Construction of a wheeled robot so that the person may sit comfortably. It must have a very different design from actual motor driven wheeled chairs for disabled persons.\</span\>\<br /\> \<span style=\"color: \#993300;\"\>2 -- The wheeled robot must be able to move avoiding obstacles through perfectly known spaces of a specific museum. The software needed for such a task, as well as the mechanical solutions represent a significant challenge.\</span\>\<br /\> \<span style=\"color: \#993300;\"\>3 -- The wheeled robot must accept questions of the visitor referring to activities and services which are specific of a single museum by using natural language.\</span\>\<br /\> \<span style=\"color: \#993300;\"\>The development of a prototype useful for a specific museum may be reprogrammed for other specific museums once the areas, services and objects of the museum are known.\</span\>\</p\> \<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"\>\<span style=\"color: \#993300;\"\>\<a style=\"color: \#993300;\" href=\"http://www.angeloferrari.it/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Progetto-H2020-BUTLER-JEROME-2015.pdf\"\>Leggi Progetto H2020 BUTLER JEROME 2015 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\</a\>\</span\>\</p\> http://www.angeloferrari.it/?feed=rss2&p=794 0
