In some cases they worsened the appearance and the conditions of the artwork. The use of inorganic coating can override these problems, due to their long term stability; moreover, it can improve the &\#8220;self-conservation&\#8221; of the artwork, for example in the case of titanium dioxide, that gives self-cleaning (super-hydrophilicity) and antimicrobial effect to the treated surface.\</span\>\</p\> \<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"\>\<span style=\"color: \#993300;\"\>\<a style=\"color: \#993300;\" href=\"http://www.angeloferrari.it/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Progetto-H2020-NATECH-2015.pdf\"\>Leggi Progetto H2020 NATECH 2015 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\</a\>\</span\>\</p\> http://www.angeloferrari.it/?feed=rss2&p=806 0
