The monitoring of building and structures, in general, is an important aspect of architectural heritage conservation and study. The proposed system can be a valuable tool for the two following purposes:\</span\>\<br /\> \<span style=\"color: \#993300;\"\>- Planning of restoration intervention on buildings and structures of cultural interest.\</span\>\<br /\> \<span style=\"color: \#993300;\"\>- Mapping and creation of a database of buildings of historic interest.\</span\>\<br /\> \<span style=\"color: \#993300;\"\>The availability of a fast, effective an systematic way to map buildings facades is an important tool for both the study and the planning of restoration intervention on architectural heritage. A rich database of the current state of the architectural heritage is fundamental for the classification of buildings, which is currently unavailable in many\</span\>\<br /\> \<span style=\"color: \#993300;\"\>countries. This is particularly relevant, for example, for the buildings with external walls covered by fresco paintings, as found in many historical Italian cities.\</span\>\</p\> \<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"\>\<span style=\"color: \#993300;\"\>\<a style=\"color: \#993300;\" href=\"http://www.angeloferrari.it/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Progetto-H2020-EUROPEAN-FACADES-2015.pdf\"\>Leggi Progetto H2020 EUROPEAN FACADES 2015 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\</a\>\</span\>\</p\> http://www.angeloferrari.it/?feed=rss2&p=798 0
