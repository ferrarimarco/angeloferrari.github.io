Progetto H2020 RESTORA 2015 {#progetto-h2020-restora-2015 .entry-title}
===========================

**Progetto H2020 RESTORA 2015**\
This project deals with:\
1 -- Design and development of protectives Suitable products will be prepared for an effective protective action against decay agents. These products will be developed by taking into account the supports they have to cover. The possibility to use traditional materials, already used in the past, will be carefully evaluated. Furthermore photo catalytic products will be prepared and tested on different stone materials in order to verify their effectiveness as self-cleaning agents and the absence of damages on the surfaces.\
2 -- Biotic damage: characterization, treatment and protection particular attention will be devoted to autotrophic (algae, lichens, musk, bacteria, weeds, etc.) and heterotrophic organisms (fungi, insects, etc.). The different species and their danger will be established together with adequate methodologies of protection against the risk, and, in case of attack, the best way of treatment which, taking into account the nature of the assets, must be respectful both of them by not causing further damages and also of the people who will benefit from the work of art.\
3 -- Moisture in wall paintings.\
As well known rising damp is a major cause of decay to masonry materials such as stone, brick, mortar and plaster. Rising damp occurs as result of capillary rise (suction) of water from the ground through the network of pores in the permeable masonry material.  accurate diagnosis of the cause and extent of the damp problem is a fundamental step in the case of conservation science of wall paintings. The porous mortar backing provides an easy route for the flow of diluted salt solutions. Salts contained in the mortar can be transported to the plaster underlying the painting. The volumetric expansion associated with the crystallization of these salts affects the plaster-pigment adhesion and leads to the disintegration of the surface. Such processes of leaching, transport, accumulation, solute concentration, precipitation, fractionation, and local concentration depend on the moisture content of the masonry which in turn is subject to seasonal variations in atmospheric humidity. For these reasons, before performing any restoration treatment the moisture distribution in a wall painting should be known. The efficiency of products already used in the past will be checked in order to evaluate their possible reuse, also after a  modification of their physico-chemical properties and/or of the application techniques. Research and development of specific instruments and technologies for evaluating the effectiveness of the products by natural or artificial ageing processes. Indication of techniques, methods, materials and protectives to be used in the conservation and in the scheduled clearing treatments to be executed on artifacts, after the intervention, also taking into account the environmental variations.\
Development of guide methodologies for the preliminary analysis of the buildings, for the design and for the intervention of architectural restoration. Preparation of stable protectives against sun or artificial-light. Setting up of a protocol for the conditions of lighting, aimed at reducing the photo decay action, with an acceptable availability of the work of art. List of the main bio deteriogenic organisms for the different classes of goods and for the related danger, with the indication of the degree of possible damage, of the threshold of the intervention and of the more appropriate fighting for every typology.
