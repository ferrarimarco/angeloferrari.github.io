**Progetto H2020 EUROPEAN FACADES 2015**\
This study proposal is aimed at the study and development of a system based on tethered MAV (Micro Aerial Vehicles) for the automatic inspection and monitoring of building facades and large structures. The monitoring of building and structures, in general, is an important aspect of architectural heritage conservation and study. The proposed system can be a valuable tool for the two following purposes:\
- Planning of restoration intervention on buildings and structures of cultural interest.\
- Mapping and creation of a database of buildings of historic interest.\
The availability of a fast, effective an systematic way to map buildings facades is an important tool for both the study and the planning of restoration intervention on architectural heritage. A rich database of the current state of the architectural heritage is fundamental for the classification of buildings, which is currently unavailable in many\
countries. This is particularly relevant, for example, for the buildings with external walls covered by fresco paintings, as found in many historical Italian cities.
