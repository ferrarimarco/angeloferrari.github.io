Up to now, Horizon 2020 Calls for Proposals, topics and budgets, were decided for the first two years 2014-2015.\</span\>\<br /\> \<span style=\"color: \#993300;\"\>Objective of this proposal is to examine an European Scenario where one or more Member State, under the pressure of internal financial shocks, i.e. a GDP significant decrease or for other economical and/or political reasons, might not be able to contribute to the EU's long-term budget according to the established amount. According to the Revision Clause of the European Parliament that takes into account the "economic situation at the time", 2016, also the overall Horizon 2020 budget might suffer a decrease for the next years. Objective of this proposal, to be carried out with the help of economists, scientists and industrial entrepreneurs, of the 28 Member States, is to submit for the next five years 2016-2020 the Horizon 2020 Programme to a "stress test" in order to examine what might happen in case of different budget decreases. In fact, there are many possible approaches: for instance, a simple linear cut to the budgets of the future Calls, or to propose different priorities or postponing some topics after 2020, etc. etc.\</span\>\<br /\> \<span style=\"color: \#993300;\"\>It seems useful that the scientific and industrial European world suggests some criteria and priorities in case of future decreases of Horizon 2020 budget at the mid-term revision of 2016 in order to submit their conclusions to the European Commission Authorities that have the responsibility to plan and schedule scientific activities to be carried out under the Horizon 2020 Programme for the next five years.\</span\>\</p\> \<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"\>\<span style=\"color: \#993300;\"\>\<a style=\"color: \#993300;\" href=\"http://www.angeloferrari.it/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Progetto-H2020-STRESS-HORIZON-2015.pdf\"\>Leggi Progetto H2020 STRESS HORIZON 2015 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\</a\>\</span\>\</p\> http://www.angeloferrari.it/?feed=rss2&p=827 0

In any case, we may for sure state that the patrimony worth saving is made up of many million pieces. Today, many scientific and technological methodologies are employed to preserve our world cultural patrimony; however, only in a few cases the enormous potentialities offered by the Robotic Systems were exploited. The complexity of the activities needed to safeguard Cultural Heritage strictly depends on the complexity of what we vaguely defined world cultural patrimony or Cultural Heritage, putting together items as different as metal moneys, paintings, historical buildings and monuments like churches and mosques, books and manuscripts, musical instruments, bones and mummies, ancient trees, and so on. The potentialities offered by the use of Robotic Systems for Cultural Heritage are extremely appealing and represent a challenge for scientists and entrepreneurs who want to  experiment new ideas and new products.\</span\>\<br /\> \<span style=\"color: \#993300;\"\> The challenge:\</span\>\<br /\> \<span style=\"color: \#993300;\"\> 1 &\#8211; Cultural Heritage items amount to many millions, spread all over the world where local communities are ready to spend money to preserve their own Cultural Heritage because it represents their own Cultural Identity as well as a source of money from tourism fluxes.\</span\>\<br /\> \<span style=\"color: \#993300;\"\> 2 &\#8211; There are significant advantages in terms of costs and manageability for the Robotic Systems with respect to other classical technologies and methodologies.

Rising damp occurs as result of capillary rise (suction) of water from the ground through the network of pores in the permeable masonry material.  accurate diagnosis of the cause and extent of the damp problem is a fundamental step in the case of conservation science of wall paintings. The porous mortar backing provides an easy route for the flow of diluted salt solutions. Salts contained in the mortar can be transported to the plaster underlying the painting. The volumetric expansion associated with the crystallization of these salts affects the plaster-pigment adhesion and leads to the disintegration of the surface. Such processes of leaching, transport, accumulation, solute concentration, precipitation, fractionation, and local concentration depend on the moisture content of the masonry which in turn is subject to seasonal variations in atmospheric humidity. For these reasons, before performing any restoration treatment the moisture distribution in a wall painting should be known. The efficiency of products already used in the past will be checked in order to evaluate their possible reuse, also after a  modification of their physico-chemical properties and/or of the application techniques. Research and development of specific instruments and technologies for evaluating the effectiveness of the products by natural or artificial ageing processes.

In addition, X-ray images can often allow virtual restorations and replicate the objects with 3D printers that are becoming very performing. The equipment for X-ray imaging, with fixed and portable solutions, has been widely developed in industry, quality control and maintenance of pipelines, as well as for the human medical diagnostics. In recent years, some of these devices have been adapted to diagnostics for Cultural Heritage. However their use in this field has always resulted in restrictions with the consequence that their potentialities have not ben fully exploited.

Nevertheless tourism statistics show that there is a continuous increase all over Europe of aged persons visiting museums. Difficulties to move inside huge galleries, to understand directional internal signs, to find essential services like restrooms, cafeterias, etc, may deprive an aged person of the pleasure of the visit. The use of wheel chairs for disabled persons, either hand or motor driven, is always possible but they represent a rather rude and sometimes offensive solution for many visitors who will refuse to use these facilities.\</span\>\<br /\> \<span style=\"color: \#993300;\"\>Objective of this proposal is to create a an independent wheeled robot prototype called "Butler Jerome" which has to be specific for a single museum. Its main feature is its perfect knowledge of the spaces and services of that museum, both single objects like paintings and s culptures but also the position of services like caffetterias, restrooms, shopping areas. It has to be able to move inside the museum interacting with an aged person sitting on it with natural language so that the visitor may ask questions relative to single objects and services inside that specific museum. The project has to be divided into the following steps:\</span\>\<br /\> \<span style=\"color: \#993300;\"\>1 -- Construction of a wheeled robot so that the person may sit comfortably. It must have a very different design from actual motor driven wheeled chairs for disabled persons.\</span\>\<br /\> \<span style=\"color: \#993300;\"\>2 -- The wheeled robot must be able to move avoiding obstacles through perfectly known spaces of a specific museum. The software needed for such a task, as well as the mechanical solutions represent a significant challenge.\</span\>\<br /\> \<span style=\"color: \#993300;\"\>3 -- The wheeled robot must accept questions of the visitor referring to activities and services which are specific of a single museum by using natural language.\</span\>\<br /\> \<span style=\"color: \#993300;\"\>The development of a prototype useful for a specific museum may be reprogrammed for other specific museums once the areas, services and objects of the museum are known.\</span\>\</p\> \<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"\>\<span style=\"color: \#993300;\"\>\<a style=\"color: \#993300;\" href=\"http://www.angeloferrari.it/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Progetto-H2020-BUTLER-JEROME-2015.pdf\"\>Leggi Progetto H2020 BUTLER JEROME 2015 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\</a\>\</span\>\</p\> http://www.angeloferrari.it/?feed=rss2&p=794 0

Cultural Heritage defines the diversity existing among our populations. Cultural Heritage helps to fight against cultural poverty, which represents a large part of poverty nowadays and poverty should be defined as a lack of knowledge and education, lack of cultural opportunities. This Project studies in detail how our common European Cultural Heritage may influence cohesion among the European citizens of the 28 countries of the EU. Our common Cultural Heritage may increase or restore cohesion, giving a "sense of pride" of being members of the EU, evolving to European Identity. The proposed actions concern specifically communication media, public instruction Institutions, and city managers.\</span\>\<br /\> \<span style=\"color: \#993300;\"\> i &\#8211; The effects of Mass Media on European cohesion: how Cultural Heritage interacts and might better interact with a better cohesion feeling among EU citizens.\</span\>\<br /\> \<span style=\"color: \#993300;\"\> ii &\#8211; The effects of urban scenarios: how historical buildings, squares, and any other architectural objects influence the life of EU citizens.\</span\>\<br /\> \<span style=\"color: \#993300;\"\> iii -The effects of Europeanization: the emergence of a "sense of pride" in second and third generation migrants for feeling themselves true citizens of the European Union.\</span\>\<br /\> \<span style=\"color: \#993300;\"\> European integration is not only an economic and political process, but a socio-cultural process. The creation of a European collective identity seemed to be a challenge from the beginning of the Union. The theory that Europe could fail because of a &\#8220;lack of mythology&\#8221; keeps referring us back to the efforts of Euro pean institutions that aimed at creating a European identity. The European Union should not only be seen as a politically and rationally organized group of nations. The European project needs also an emotional foundation, a shared sense of community and cohesion.\</span\>\</p\> \<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"\>\<span style=\"color: \#993300;\"\>\<a style=\"color: \#993300;\" href=\"http://www.angeloferrari.it/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Progetto-H2020-Our-Identity-2015.pdf\"\>Leggi Progetto H2020 Our Identity 2015 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\</a\>\</span\>\</p\> http://www.angeloferrari.it/?feed=rss2&p=786 0
