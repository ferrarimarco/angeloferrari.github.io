An important role is played by the radiographic and tomographic X Imaging. Both methodologies allow to study the internal structure of the artefacts; however tomography has the advantage of being able to develop three-dimensional models. The experimental results of these methodologies are digital radiographic images, that are an easy-to-access digital documentation, archiving and sharing. In addition, X-ray images can often allow virtual restorations and replicate the objects with 3D printers that are becoming very performing. The equipment for X-ray imaging, with fixed and portable solutions, has been widely developed in industry, quality control and maintenance of pipelines, as well as for the human medical diagnostics. In recent years, some of these devices have been adapted to diagnostics for Cultural Heritage. However their use in this field has always resulted in restrictions with the consequence that their potentialities have not ben fully exploited. Over the last decade , non-industrial equipment have been developed in research centers. Our aim is to provide a mobile tool to be placed on the market at an affordable price.\</span\>\</p\> \<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"\>\<span style=\"color: \#993300;\"\>\<a style=\"color: \#993300;\" href=\"http://www.angeloferrari.it/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Progetto-H2020-FANTOM-X-2015.pdf\"\>Leggi Progetto H2020 FANTOM X 2015 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\</a\>\</span\>\</p\> http://www.angeloferrari.it/?feed=rss2&p=802 0
