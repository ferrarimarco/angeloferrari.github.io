==========================

**Progetto H2020 NATECH 2015**\
"The exploitation of nanotechnology for the safeguard and conservation of Cultural Heritage is rather recent and deals with innovative materials to be used for the diagnostics, the restoration and conservation of many artifacts, as wall paintings, archaeological objects, buildings easel paintings, wood, ancient papers and manuscripts, concrete, steels, polymers and related composites, etc.\
This Project deals with the following activities:\
1--Diagnostics by nano markers High performance new facilities and nondestructive and/or nano-invasive methods to be used especially in situ (spectroscopic, spectrometric, diffractometric, electron microscopy techniques) capable to identify qualitatively and quantitatively at nanometric or molecular level the morphology, structure and composition of different materials, together with their compatibility with the substrate, their stability and reactivity, the mechanical and thermal properties, etc. and to detect suitable nano or molecular deterioration markers to be used in fast and inexpensive determination of the state of conservation and of incipient decay processes.\
2 -- Restoration by nano-systems\
· clearing procedures based on micelles and nano-emulsions or other nano-systems as nano-structural gels.\
· calcium alkoxides: tailored nano-products as consolidants and coatings, especially for the conservation of historical buildings. Some examples are nano-dispersions as Ca(OH) 2 , Sr(OH) 2, Ba(OH) 2 , Sr(OH) 2 ), as consolidants of suitable carbonated substrates (marbles, etc.).\
· Silane/syloxane, acrylic and silica nano-dispersions, using inorganic, organic and mixed consolidant products.\
· Nano-silica injected in the substrate of wall paintings. This action could be alternative to nano-lime actually used while zirconia and/or alumina nanoparticles can improve mechanical resistance of artwork surface layer and go deeper inside the body of the piece.\
· polymeric nanosilicate nanocomposite (nanofillers into a polymeric matrix)\
· photocatalytic cement-based materials\
· bio deterioration restoration based or nano biocatalysts\
· functionalized alkoxy silane for deacidification and consolidation of paper..\
· carbon nanotubes for mechanical improvement of timber structures.\
3 -- Conservation by nano -- systems\
· Organic resins used in latest fifty years demonstrated poor time and weather resistance. In some cases they worsened the appearance and the conditions of the artwork. The use of inorganic coating can override these problems, due to their long term stability; moreover, it can improve the "self-conservation" of the artwork, for example in the case of titanium dioxide, that gives self-cleaning (super-hydrophilicity) and antimicrobial effect to the treated surface.
