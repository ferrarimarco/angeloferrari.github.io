In recent years, many efforts have been made by the Government, with a decisive support from the EU (thinking only to Pompei Project), to intervene both on the side of a better and more careful conservation, and on that of a wider, diversified and attractive fruition. This is why, in the European Cultural Heritage year, it seems appropriate to make this proposal which, based on the scientific knowledge of our Institute, wants to offer to the VET system updated and interesting tools for unconventional professional choices. The project focuses on the aspects of the protection and enhancement of the Cultural and Natural Heritage (considered, collectively, as &\#8216;Non-Negotiable Goods&\#8217; -BNN-). It is thought for a target group of teachers and trainers, and of the entire VET system, especially those active in such areas as tourism, agrarian / agro-food / agro-industry, restoration and recovery of architectural and cultural heritage and post-diploma courses, such as: &\#8220;construction, environment and territory&\#8221; or &\#8220;transformation and enhancement of local food and wine and food productions &\#8220;.\</span\>\</p\> http://www.angeloferrari.it/?feed=rss2&p=1743 0

This Project was the most effective action in Europe in this field as far as science and technology are concerned: a 30 million euro project with more than 3,000 scientists. That action was financed by the Italian Ministry of Research and by the Italian National Research Council (CNR) and was prepared and developed by a team of scientists under the leadership of prof. Angelo Guarino. The same team is nowadays gathered inside the \<em\>"Investing in Culture"\</em\> Association, president prof. A.
