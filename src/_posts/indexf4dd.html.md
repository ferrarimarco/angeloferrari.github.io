**Progetto H2020 STRESS HORIZON 2015**\
A key achievement of the new European Parliament has been to insert a "revision clause" which will require the new European Commission to present a review of the functioning of the EU'S long-run budget (Multi-annual Financial Framework -- MFF) in 2016 taking full account of the economic situation at the time. Up to now, Horizon 2020 Calls for Proposals, topics and budgets, were decided for the first two years 2014-2015.\
Objective of this proposal is to examine an European Scenario where one or more Member State, under the pressure of internal financial shocks, i.e. a GDP significant decrease or for other economical and/or political reasons, might not be able to contribute to the EU's long-term budget according to the established amount. According to the Revision Clause of the European Parliament that takes into account the "economic situation at the time", 2016, also the overall Horizon 2020 budget might suffer a decrease for the next years. Objective of this proposal, to be carried out with the help of economists, scientists and industrial entrepreneurs, of the 28 Member States, is to submit for the next five years 2016-2020 the Horizon 2020 Programme to a "stress test" in order to examine what might happen in case of different budget decreases. In fact, there are many possible approaches: for instance, a simple linear cut to the budgets of the future Calls, or to propose different priorities or postponing some topics after 2020, etc. etc.\
It seems useful that the scientific and industrial European world suggests some criteria and priorities in case of future decreases of Horizon 2020 budget at the mid-term revision of 2016 in order to submit their conclusions to the European Commission Authorities that have the responsibility to plan and schedule scientific activities to be carried out under the Horizon 2020 Programme for the next five years.
