In any case, we may for sure state that the patrimony worth saving is made up of many million pieces. Today, many scientific and technological methodologies are employed to preserve our world cultural patrimony; however, only in a few cases the enormous potentialities offered by the Robotic Systems were exploited. The complexity of the activities needed to safeguard Cultural Heritage strictly depends on the complexity of what we vaguely defined world cultural patrimony or Cultural Heritage, putting together items as different as metal moneys, paintings, historical buildings and monuments like churches and mosques, books and manuscripts, musical instruments, bones and mummies, ancient trees, and so on. The potentialities offered by the use of Robotic Systems for Cultural Heritage are extremely appealing and represent a challenge for scientists and entrepreneurs who want to  experiment new ideas and new products.\</span\>\<br /\> \<span style=\"color: \#993300;\"\> The challenge:\</span\>\<br /\> \<span style=\"color: \#993300;\"\> 1 &\#8211; Cultural Heritage items amount to many millions, spread all over the world where local communities are ready to spend money to preserve their own Cultural Heritage because it represents their own Cultural Identity as well as a source of money from tourism fluxes.\</span\>\<br /\> \<span style=\"color: \#993300;\"\> 2 &\#8211; There are significant advantages in terms of costs and manageability for the Robotic Systems with respect to other classical technologies and methodologies.
