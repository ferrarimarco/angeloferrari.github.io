**Progetto H2020 RICH 2015 -- 2015**\
How large and spread all over the world is the cultural patrimony we want to preserve?\
The vagueness of this terminology makes rather difficult to answer such a question. In any case, we may for sure state that the patrimony worth saving is made up of many million pieces. Today, many scientific and technological methodologies are employed to preserve our world cultural patrimony; however, only in a few cases the enormous potentialities offered by the Robotic Systems were exploited. The complexity of the activities needed to safeguard Cultural Heritage strictly depends on the complexity of what we vaguely defined world cultural patrimony or Cultural Heritage, putting together items as different as metal moneys, paintings, historical buildings and monuments like churches and mosques, books and manuscripts, musical instruments, bones and mummies, ancient trees, and so on. The potentialities offered by the use of Robotic Systems for Cultural Heritage are extremely appealing and represent a challenge for scientists and entrepreneurs who want to  experiment new ideas and new products.\
The challenge:\
1 -- Cultural Heritage items amount to many millions, spread all over the world where local communities are ready to spend money to preserve their own Cultural Heritage because it represents their own Cultural Identity as well as a source of money from tourism fluxes.\
2 -- There are significant advantages in terms of costs and manageability for the Robotic Systems with respect to other classical technologies and methodologies. Compact, intelligent machines may prove to be competitive with respect to other complex machines that need a continuous presence of a human being, 24 hours per day.\
3 -- Robotic Systems must be mobile, lightweight, and easily portable, with easy manageability: no prototypes needing continuous presence of scientists, or IT experts or technicians. End users are generally employees, civil servants of public or private institutions, with no specific scientific background.\
4 -- Robotic Systems must be always conceived and developed in collaboration with experts of Cultural Heritage.\
5 -- Robotic Systems developed for Cultural Heritage may find further employs in close fields like environmental studies of the territory, in domotics, etc.
