**Progetto H2020 RICH 2015 -- 2015**\
How large and spread all over the world is the cultural patrimony we want to preserve?\
The vagueness of this terminology makes rather difficult to answer such a question. In any case, we may for sure state that the patrimony worth saving is made up of many million pieces. Today, many scientific and technological methodologies are employed to preserve our world cultural patrimony; however, only in a few cases the enormous potentialities offered by the Robotic Systems were exploited. The complexity of the activities needed to safeguard Cultural Heritage strictly depends on the complexity of what we vaguely defined world cultural patrimony or Cultural Heritage, putting together items as different as metal moneys, paintings, historical buildings and monuments like churches and mosques, books and manuscripts, musical instruments, bones and mummies, ancient trees, and so on. The potentialities offered by the use of Robotic Systems for Cultural Heritage are extremely appealing and represent a challenge for scientists and entrepreneurs who want to  experiment new ideas and new products.\
The challenge:\
1 -- Cultural Heritage items amount to many millions, spread all over the world where local communities are ready to spend money to preserve their own Cultural Heritage because it represents their own Cultural Identity as well as a source of money from tourism fluxes.\
2 -- There are significant advantages in terms of costs and manageability for the Robotic Systems with respect to other classical technologies and methodologies. Compact, intelligent machines may prove to be competitive with respect to other complex machines that need a continuous presence of a human being, 24 hours per day.\
3 -- Robotic Systems must be mobile, lightweight, and easily portable, with easy manageability: no prototypes needing continuous presence of scientists, or IT experts or technicians. End users are generally employees, civil servants of public or private institutions, with no specific scientific background.\
4 -- Robotic Systems must be always conceived and developed in collaboration with experts of Cultural Heritage.\
5 -- Robotic Systems developed for Cultural Heritage may find further employs in close fields like environmental studies of the territory, in domotics, etc.

===================================================

**Progetto H2020 RESTORA 2015**\
This project deals with:\
1 -- Design and development of protectives Suitable products will be prepared for an effective protective action against decay agents. These products will be developed by taking into account the supports they have to cover. The possibility to use traditional materials, already used in the past, will be carefully evaluated. Furthermore photo catalytic products will be prepared and tested on different stone materials in order to verify their effectiveness as self-cleaning agents and the absence of damages on the surfaces.\
2 -- Biotic damage: characterization, treatment and protection particular attention will be devoted to autotrophic (algae, lichens, musk, bacteria, weeds, etc.) and heterotrophic organisms (fungi, insects, etc.). The different species and their danger will be established together with adequate methodologies of protection against the risk, and, in case of attack, the best way of treatment which, taking into account the nature of the assets, must be respectful both of them by not causing further damages and also of the people who will benefit from the work of art.\
3 -- Moisture in wall paintings.\
As well known rising damp is a major cause of decay to masonry materials such as stone, brick, mortar and plaster. Rising damp occurs as result of capillary rise (suction) of water from the ground through the network of pores in the permeable masonry material.  accurate diagnosis of the cause and extent of the damp problem is a fundamental step in the case of conservation science of wall paintings. The porous mortar backing provides an easy route for the flow of diluted salt solutions. Salts contained in the mortar can be transported to the plaster underlying the painting. The volumetric expansion associated with the crystallization of these salts affects the plaster-pigment adhesion and leads to the disintegration of the surface. Such processes of leaching, transport, accumulation, solute concentration, precipitation, fractionation, and local concentration depend on the moisture content of the masonry which in turn is subject to seasonal variations in atmospheric humidity. For these reasons, before performing any restoration treatment the moisture distribution in a wall painting should be known. The efficiency of products already used in the past will be checked in order to evaluate their possible reuse, also after a  modification of their physico-chemical properties and/or of the application techniques. Research and development of specific instruments and technologies for evaluating the effectiveness of the products by natural or artificial ageing processes. Indication of techniques, methods, materials and protectives to be used in the conservation and in the scheduled clearing treatments to be executed on artifacts, after the intervention, also taking into account the environmental variations.\
Development of guide methodologies for the preliminary analysis of the buildings, for the design and for the intervention of architectural restoration. Preparation of stable protectives against sun or artificial-light. Setting up of a protocol for the conditions of lighting, aimed at reducing the photo decay action, with an acceptable availability of the work of art. List of the main bio deteriogenic organisms for the different classes of goods and for the related danger, with the indication of the degree of possible damage, of the threshold of the intervention and of the more appropriate fighting for every typology.

**Progetto H2020 POMPEIILAB 2015**\
The landscape is a tool through which we can view our reality, initiating a process of rebuilding our contemporary identity. It allows us to position ourselves in the world, to relate to our history, to let us feel "living together". The landscape is intimately linked to the possible relationship with the man and the natural events which shape its look. Traditionally, the approach to the landscape reveals the identity of individuals who live in contact. Everyone watching from a personal perspective, the result of a set of human, aesthetic and scientific relations. Today the landscape acts as a tool to understand the signs of our lives. Past and present. It, directly or indirectly, inspires our common life. In this context, the project PompeiiLab aims to reconstruct and describe the past history and the contradictions of the modern Vesuvius landscape.\
More specifically, the history of the archaeological site of Pompeii, with its presence of ancient area in a contemporary landscape. The evolution of the landscape is in fact deeply linked to the evolution of civilizations that occupied or abandoned it, according to the catastrophic natural events of different times. The scientific data that will be obtained by geological, archaeological, anthropological, botanic, and historical researches, and from the study of agricultural techniques, as well as by several three-dimensional models of the\
landscape in different historical periods; they will provide the opportunity for scholars, students, and ordinary citizens to learn about the history of the place in which they live, by means of a popular and creative model. The reconstruction of a three-dimensional landscape will be connected to a soundscape, an olfactory contribution, and an explanation of the places.. An entertainment space dedicated to the enjoyment will welcome visitors through three-dimensional installations that allow observing the sites and their subsequent transformations over time. Sound systems will talk about the natural features and the presence of man. The visit will be brought forward by a didactic section, provided in several languages, preparatory to the visit. This installation may be taken as a high-definition demonstration prototype that can be employed for other archaeological sites and museums.

"The exploitation of nanotechnology for the safeguard and conservation of Cultural Heritage is rather recent and deals with innovative materials to be used for the diagnostics, the restoration and conservation of many artifacts, as wall paintings, archaeological objects, buildings easel paintings, wood, ancient papers and manuscripts, concrete, steels, polymers and related composites, etc.\
This Project deals with the following activities:\
1--Diagnostics by nano markers High performance new facilities and nondestructive and/or nano-invasive methods to be used especially in situ (spectroscopic, spectrometric, diffractometric, electron microscopy techniques) capable to identify qualitatively and quantitatively at nanometric or molecular level the morphology, structure and composition of different materials, together with their compatibility with the substrate, their stability and reactivity, the mechanical and thermal properties, etc. and to detect suitable nano or molecular deterioration markers to be used in fast and inexpensive determination of the state of conservation and of incipient decay processes.\
2 -- Restoration by nano-systems\
· clearing procedures based on micelles and nano-emulsions or other nano-systems as nano-structural gels.\
· calcium alkoxides: tailored nano-products as consolidants and coatings, especially for the conservation of historical buildings. Some examples are nano-dispersions as Ca(OH) 2 , Sr(OH) 2, Ba(OH) 2 , Sr(OH) 2 ), as consolidants of suitable carbonated substrates (marbles, etc.).\
· Silane/syloxane, acrylic and silica nano-dispersions, using inorganic, organic and mixed consolidant products.\
· Nano-silica injected in the substrate of wall paintings. This action could be alternative to nano-lime actually used while zirconia and/or alumina nanoparticles can improve mechanical resistance of artwork surface layer and go deeper inside the body of the piece.\
· polymeric nanosilicate nanocomposite (nanofillers into a polymeric matrix)\
· photocatalytic cement-based materials\
· bio deterioration restoration based or nano biocatalysts\
· functionalized alkoxy silane for deacidification and consolidation of paper..\
· carbon nanotubes for mechanical improvement of timber structures.\
3 -- Conservation by nano -- systems\
· Organic resins used in latest fifty years demonstrated poor time and weather resistance. In some cases they worsened the appearance and the conditions of the artwork. The use of inorganic coating can override these problems, due to their long term stability; moreover, it can improve the "self-conservation" of the artwork, for example in the case of titanium dioxide, that gives self-cleaning (super-hydrophilicity) and antimicrobial effect to the treated surface.

**Progetto H2020 FANTOM X 2015**\
Before undertaking any kind of restoration of Cultural Heritage, it is important to deal with non-invasive and non-destructive diagnostic analyses. An important role is played by the radiographic and tomographic X Imaging. Both methodologies allow to study the internal structure of the artefacts; however tomography has the advantage of being able to develop three-dimensional models. The experimental results of these methodologies are digital radiographic images, that are an easy-to-access digital documentation, archiving and sharing. In addition, X-ray images can often allow virtual restorations and replicate the objects with 3D printers that are becoming very performing. The equipment for X-ray imaging, with fixed and portable solutions, has been widely developed in industry, quality control and maintenance of pipelines, as well as for the human medical diagnostics. In recent years, some of these devices have been adapted to diagnostics for Cultural Heritage. However their use in this field has always resulted in restrictions with the consequence that their potentialities have not ben fully exploited. Over the last decade , non-industrial equipment have been developed in research centers. Our aim is to provide a mobile tool to be placed on the market at an affordable price.

**Progetto H2020 EUROPEAN FACADES 2015**\
This study proposal is aimed at the study and development of a system based on tethered MAV (Micro Aerial Vehicles) for the automatic inspection and monitoring of building facades and large structures. The monitoring of building and structures, in general, is an important aspect of architectural heritage conservation and study. The proposed system can be a valuable tool for the two following purposes:\
- Planning of restoration intervention on buildings and structures of cultural interest.\
- Mapping and creation of a database of buildings of historic interest.\
The availability of a fast, effective an systematic way to map buildings facades is an important tool for both the study and the planning of restoration intervention on architectural heritage. A rich database of the current state of the architectural heritage is fundamental for the classification of buildings, which is currently unavailable in many\
countries. This is particularly relevant, for example, for the buildings with external walls covered by fresco paintings, as found in many historical Italian cities.

**Progetto H2020 BUTLER JEROME 2015**\
For aged as well as disabled persons the visit of a museum like the Louvre, the British Museum or the Uffizi is quite a difficult and tiring task. Nevertheless tourism statistics show that there is a continuous increase all over Europe of aged persons visiting museums. Difficulties to move inside huge galleries, to understand directional internal signs, to find essential services like restrooms, cafeterias, etc, may deprive an aged person of the pleasure of the visit. The use of wheel chairs for disabled persons, either hand or motor driven, is always possible but they represent a rather rude and sometimes offensive solution for many visitors who will refuse to use these facilities.\
Objective of this proposal is to create a an independent wheeled robot prototype called "Butler Jerome" which has to be specific for a single museum. Its main feature is its perfect knowledge of the spaces and services of that museum, both single objects like paintings and s culptures but also the position of services like caffetterias, restrooms, shopping areas. It has to be able to move inside the museum interacting with an aged person sitting on it with natural language so that the visitor may ask questions relative to single objects and services inside that specific museum. The project has to be divided into the following steps:\
1 -- Construction of a wheeled robot so that the person may sit comfortably. It must have a very different design from actual motor driven wheeled chairs for disabled persons.\
2 -- The wheeled robot must be able to move avoiding obstacles through perfectly known spaces of a specific museum. The software needed for such a task, as well as the mechanical solutions represent a significant challenge.\
3 -- The wheeled robot must accept questions of the visitor referring to activities and services which are specific of a single museum by using natural language.\
The development of a prototype useful for a specific museum may be reprogrammed for other specific museums once the areas, services and objects of the museum are known.

**Progetto H2020 Our Identity 2015**\
Cultural Heritage represents the cultural roots of the Identity of a population like in a tree the branches, the flowers, the fruits stand up and draw their lymph from the roots. Cultural Heritage defines the diversity existing among our populations. Cultural Heritage helps to fight against cultural poverty, which represents a large part of poverty nowadays and poverty should be defined as a lack of knowledge and education, lack of cultural opportunities. This Project studies in detail how our common European Cultural Heritage may influence cohesion among the European citizens of the 28 countries of the EU. Our common Cultural Heritage may increase or restore cohesion, giving a "sense of pride" of being members of the EU, evolving to European Identity. The proposed actions concern specifically communication media, public instruction Institutions, and city managers.\
i -- The effects of Mass Media on European cohesion: how Cultural Heritage interacts and might better interact with a better cohesion feeling among EU citizens.\
ii -- The effects of urban scenarios: how historical buildings, squares, and any other architectural objects influence the life of EU citizens.\
iii -The effects of Europeanization: the emergence of a "sense of pride" in second and third generation migrants for feeling themselves true citizens of the European Union.\
European integration is not only an economic and political process, but a socio-cultural process. The creation of a European collective identity seemed to be a challenge from the beginning of the Union. The theory that Europe could fail because of a "lack of mythology" keeps referring us back to the efforts of Euro pean institutions that aimed at creating a European identity. The European Union should not only be seen as a politically and rationally organized group of nations. The European project needs also an emotional foundation, a shared sense of community and cohesion.

**BENI CULTURALI**\
(Dibattito)

Che cosa sono i Beni Culturali?\
*I Beni Culturali sono l'insieme delle testimonianze materiali dell'identità culturale di un popolo.* E se l'insieme di queste testimonianze materiali costituisce l'identità culturale di un popolo allora queste stesse testimonianze definiscono anche la sua diversità e rappresentano la sua singolarità.\
Certamente, l'immensità del patrimonio culturale italiano rende difficile l'opera di salvaguardia: basti pensare che gli oltre ottomila comuni italiani sono in realtà ottomila musei a cielo aperto che vanno difesi dai danni naturali, come i terremoti, ai danni ambientali provocati dagli stessi cittadini. E qui viene giusto presentare un problema dalla soluzione impossibile: quali e quanti sono i monumenti e i documenti che vogliamo restaurare e conservare? Chi li sceglie e con quali criteri? Il problema è stato risolto in vari modi in Europa: ad esempio, nel Regno Unito si sono compilate delle liste di monumenti da conservare a spese dello Stato; altre nazioni preferiscono affidarsi agli elenchi dell'Unesco sui monumenti patrimonio dell'umanità; molti, nel nostro Paese, semplicemente vorrebbero tutto restaurare e conservare. Forse questo problema è insolubile perché mal posto: forse dobbiamo domandarci non "*quali e quanti*" monumenti conservare ma "*perché*" vogliamo conservarli. Solo dando una risposta corretta a questo "perché" possiamo poi decidere "quali e quanti" monumenti conservare.\
Purtroppo, il "perché" che le pubbliche Amministrazioni danno più di frequente è di questo tenore: si restaura e conserva il patrimonio perché è fonte di guadagno attraverso il turismo, sia nazionale che internazionale: converrà sempre spendere in restauri di castelli se poi milioni di turisti visitatori frutteranno miliardi. Con questa logica sono stati restaurati migliaia di manufatti monumentali in tutta Italia, con una conseguenza: che le spese di manutenzione sono maggiori del gettito che deriva dal loro sfruttamento turistico e congressuale. Forse, la risposta al quesito: "perché conservare" deve essere ricercata nel convincere i cittadini a restaurare e conservare il proprio patrimonio in quanto esso è un bene in se, da lasciare ai propri figli, perché rappresenta le proprie radici.\
La RAI, che rappresenta l'industria culturale italiana più importante può potentemente contribuire a sviluppare nei cittadini la consapevolezza della conservazione e del rispetto per i propri Beni Culturali.\
Nel dibattito verranno rapidamente illustrati questi concetti mediante tre diversi esempi del lavoro dei nostri ricercatori nel settore del restauro pittorico e architettonico utilizzando come esempi il restauro del Crocifisso del Cimabue ed il recupero delle Basiliche di San Francesco d'Assisi e Santa Sofia a Costantinopoli. Inoltre verrà esposto l'insieme delle attività relative alla diffusione delle conoscenze sulle tecnologie per la salvaguardia dei Beni Culturali sfruttando le possibilità offerte da Internet e dalla televisione.\
