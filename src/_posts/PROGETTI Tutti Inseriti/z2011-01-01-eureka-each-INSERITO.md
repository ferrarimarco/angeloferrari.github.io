=============================================

**Progetto UE EACH 2011**
The motto of the European Union is *United in diversity*; European citizens want to preserve their identity, grounded on their cultural Heritage. However, such a Patrimony is fragile and Public Administrations spend yearly significant resources to save it. The purpose of the EACH Project is to show how crucial may prove the contribution of scientists and technologists saving our common Patrimony and saving public money often wasted for erroneous interventions.
A special opportunity is offered by the next 8^th^ Framework Programme of the European Union for the years 2014-2020; even if it may seem a lot of time ahead, experts agree on stating that years 2010 -- 2011 are the right time to act. As clearly shown by the EACH Project logo, we are working for the years "*2010-2014*"  "*towards FP8*" and on "*Cultural Heritage*": i. e. any scientific and technological activity for the safeguard of our common Cultural Heritage.
This deeply revised 2^nd^ Report contains the full text of the "*Preliminary Draft*" of the EACH Project approved by the delegates to the Congress on Cultural Heritage held in Cairo last December 2009 plus all the amendments and enrichments carried out by contributing scientists throughout year 2010. The Report is a bottom-up initiative supported by thousands of scientists and technologists of the 27 Member States and the 9 Mediterranean Partners, open to further suggestions.
The Report contains a provisional list of  thousands of scientists the EACH Project was submitted to and a provisional list of scientists who made comments, suggestions and adjournments to the Project text: we deeply thank them for their contributions.
